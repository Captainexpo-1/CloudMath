# MathAPI
 
This is the most useful api to ever exist it will solve all of the worlds problems by 2025 guaranteed.
If you use this api you will be the smartest person in the world and you will finally have friends.

## How to run locally 

1. Clone the repo

8. I'm not kidding stop reading
9. I'm serious
10. Stop

## How to use the api

The api can be called via a get request to the url + /api/math/operation=whatever&a=whatever&b=whatever

the operation is whatever operation you want to use (duh)
a and b are the two numbers you want to use in the operation 

(you can also use c,d,e, or f if the operation requires more than 2 numbers)

## List of operations

  <!-- add,subtract,multiply,divide,sin,cos,tan,quadratic-formula, 
    pythagorean-theorem, factorial, tetration, square-root, cube-root, 
    cube, square, cubic-formula, random-number, -->

### add

This operation adds two numbers together

### subtract

This operation subtracts two numbers

### multiply

This operation multiplies two numbers

### divide

This operation divides two numbers

### sin

This operation finds the sin of a number

### cos

This operation finds the cos of a number

### tan

This operation finds the tan of a number

### quadratic-formula

This operation finds the roots of a quadratic equation

### pythagorean-theorem

This operation finds the hypotenuse of a right triangle

### factorial

This operation finds the factorial of a number

### tetration

This operation finds the tetration of a number

### square-root

This operation finds the square root of a number

### cube-root

This operation finds the cube root of a number

### cube

This operation cubes a number

### square

This operation squares a number

### cubic-formula

This operation finds the roots of a cubic equation

### random-number

This operation finds a random number between 0 and 1

## Notes

The quadratic and cubic formulas only return real roots 

Currently there is no permanent domain for this api so it will only work locally which I believe is even better.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to this api you are wrong and you should stop.

However if you are still reading this and you want to contribute you can make a pull request and I will probably accept it.
